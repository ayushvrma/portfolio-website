I am Ayush, a Deep Learning Enthusiast and a Flutter Developer. Currently an undergrad pursuing Computer Science and Bussiness Systems from [Thapar University, Patiala, India](https://www.thapar.edu/).

I intend to explore deep model under low-resource training data scenario using semi-supervised and self-supervised paradigm.

My research focus is broadly centered around Computer Vision and Deep Learning.
I have gathered up some basic knowledge about Generative Adversial Networks (GANs), implemented it in PyTorch, and am currently learning Zero Shot Learning.

Apart from this, I like books and music. Contact Me if you want to chat about anything, we'll find a topic.
