Hi! I am Ayush, a Deep Learning Enthusiast and a Flutter Developer. Currently a sophomore pursuing Computer Science and Bussiness Systems from Thapar University, Patiala, India.
I have gathered up some basic knowledge about Generative Adversial Networks (GANs), implemented it in PyTorch, and am currently learning Zero Shot Learning.
