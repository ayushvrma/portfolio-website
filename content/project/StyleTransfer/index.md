title: "Style Transfer"
summary: "A Flutter Application for the deployment of a Style Mixing CNN that I trained to take the style of one image and apply it to the other and produce a final image. The model script is in python so it's integrated using Flask in a Flutter i.e. Dart Backend to run custom APIs. ngrok is used to transfer images to localhost server (for now)."
